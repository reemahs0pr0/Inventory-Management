# Inventory-Management

A simple Inventory management application(Java SpringBoot) for the local car dealership workshops that provide a collaborative workspace for mechanics and admin clerks. The web application enables admin clerks and mechanics to browse the parts currently in the inventory (the system contains inventory product details from multiple vendors).

The system follows the MVC architecture with thymeleaf-based front end. The system uses MySQL Database to store the data.
